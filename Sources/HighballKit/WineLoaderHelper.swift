/// A Wine that runs x86 programs natively on Apple silicon needs Apple's cross-architecture
/// entitlement on the loader process: it is what lets the process keep the x18 register for the
/// Windows thread block, map the low 4 GB, and set total store ordering per thread (macOS 26.5
/// and later, private/notes/rosetta-transition-plan.md). The entitlement is granted to a signed app
/// bundle carrying a provisioning profile, so the loader cannot be a file inside a downloaded
/// engine. It ships inside Highball.app as Contents/Helpers/WineLoader.app (bundle id
/// app.highball.WineLoader, built by Scripts/make-app.sh from spike/wineloader), and every arm64
/// engine's `wine` becomes a symlink to it (EngineStore.linkSignedLoader). Wine's ntdll starts child
/// processes through `<directory of ntdll.so>/wine`, and the helper looks for ntdll.so beside the
/// path it was started by, so one sealed bundle serves every engine and nothing is copied into it.
/// Measured on an M4, macOS 27.0, 2026-10-04.
